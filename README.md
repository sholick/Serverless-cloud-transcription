# Serverless-cloud-transcription

This is a proof-of-concept software to demonstrate Uploaded audio transcription service is possible on the cloud, without use of any static server.<br/><br/>
This reposit relies heavily on AWS cloud computing services, but using other tools like Google Firebase is also possible. AWS S3 is used for hosting, lambda functions for file uploading, processing and transcription, as well as Dynamo for file logging.
